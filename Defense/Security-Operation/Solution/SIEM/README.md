## `Definition`
 Security information and event management technology supports threat detection, compliance and security incident management through the collection and analysis (real-time and historical) of security events, as well as a wide variety of other event and contextual data sources.
 
 The core capabilities are a broad scope of log event collection and management, the ability to analyze log events and other data across disprate sources, and operational capabilities (incident, dashboard and reporting).
 
 A SIEM system can be rules-based or employ a statistical correlation engine to make connections between event log entries. Advanced SIEM systems have evolved to include user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), as well as security orchestration, automation and response ([SOAR](https://github.com/Jayway007/Offense-and-Deffense/tree/main/Defense/Security-Operation/Solution/SOAR)).
