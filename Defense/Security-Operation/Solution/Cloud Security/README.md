## SASE
  SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) is a cloud-based architecture resulting from the convergence of security and networking services for the purpose of protecting users, data, systems, and applications. It is an elimination of the older perimeter-based model of networking and security in favor of a cloud-based model that allows users to access data and systems securely from anywhere.


## CASB
  A Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) is an on-premises or cloud-based security policy enforcement point placed between cloud services and users to enforce security policies as cloud-based resources are accessed. On a simpler note, think of the CASB as the sheriff that enforces the laws set by the cloud service administrators.

## CSPM
   Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) evaluates security posture, this solution monitors services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and other Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) environments. CSPM monitors the security and compliance posture at the resources level that compose the custom cloud applications and workloads organizations have deployed in public cloud environments.

## SSPM
  SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) provides automated continuous monitoring of cloud-based Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) applications like Slack, Salesforce, and Microsoft 365 to minimize risky configurations, prevent configuration drift, and help security and IT teams to ensure compliance.
