# Functions
## `Login`
- default/weak-password/brute-force
- SQL Injection
- Auth Bypass
- fuzz/search for endpoints
- view source code

## `Register`
- Arbitrary register
- Repeated register
- 

## `Mind`
- Think like a developer
  - To implement the main function, must use framework, open-source or self-study?  - BI, Big data
  - Design the router and API : meaning of path and parameter
  - How to implememt the specific function, guess the backend logic:
    - logic: get the user and compare permission with hashmap?
    - module: use bash or csh to call the program : .cshrc
  - Which steps does the function has? To achieve attack goals, which condition should be fullfilled?
- How it Protect
  - What is the possible mitigation? Which part will they neglect
- What is the overall level of the system
  - Through the protection to judge the overall level, what aspects could be dismissed
- Always figure out what will happen if exception happens
- Always figure out the meaning of each parameter, how will they be handled in backend?
  - File handling
  - Acount/number calculator
- To each technique, persue be familiar to boring level
- Each vulnerability is just a entrance point, maximize the influence
  - To deep exploit the vul, need to touch the deeper and core content: 
    - core of SQLI is SQL grammar
    - core of WAF bypass is knowledge of http protocol

## `Tricks`
- Normal operation has restrict, but exception situation not
  - Adding data has limitation, add normal then modify: xss filter
  - upload check content, first upload normal than modify by runtime action : DDE
- Remember to do more handler process, decode everything
  - unicode in Java
  - base64 or AES
