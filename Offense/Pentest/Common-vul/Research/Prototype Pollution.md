#  Concept
- [Object.prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)
  
  _Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can’t be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can’t be found, then the prototype’s prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned._


- [Prototype pollution](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/prototype-pollution/)

  _Prototype pollution is a vulnerability where an attacker is able to modify Object.prototype. Because nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object, a typical object inherits properties (including methods) from Object.prototype. Changing Object.prototype can result in a wide range of issues, sometimes even resulting in remote code execution._
  
# Reason
 _Prototype pollution vulnerabilities typically arise when a JavaScript function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object, without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key like __proto__, along with arbitrary nested properties._
