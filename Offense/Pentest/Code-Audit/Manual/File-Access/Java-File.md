```
# FileInputStream

```java
FileInputStream fin=new FileInputStream("D:\\testout.txt");    
int num=fin.read();

# File
The File class is an abstract representation of file and directory pathname. A pathname can be either absolute or relative.

The File class have several methods for working with directories and files such as creating new directories or files, deleting and renaming directories or files, listing the contents of a directory etc.

## Constructor
- File(String pathname) : It creates a new File instance by converting the given pathname string into an abstract pathname.
- File(URI uri) : It creates a new File instance by converting the given file: URI into an abstract pathname.

## Methods
- getName() :	It returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
- listFiles()	: It returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname
- mkdir()	: It creates the directory named by this abstract pathname.
- createNewFile()	: It atomically creates a new, empty file named by this abstract pathname if and only if a file with this name does not yet exist.

 String extension = Request.getextension();
 CheckUtil.check(extension);
 }
