## Process
- input - filter - bypass - sink - exploit

## Tricks
- Hook and trace the heap(parameter, value)
- Assume the condition has been satisfied, write the test/demo code to debug the chain
- Deep into the logic detail: how to get into else branch

## `Denial of Service`
- Stack overflow/Memory: set junk data
- Loop handling : 
- malformed characters : URL Decoder
- Regex DoS
- connect: timeout 
- Lack Exceotion: Type forced conversion: Long.valueOf(String)

## Log Injection
- \r\n
