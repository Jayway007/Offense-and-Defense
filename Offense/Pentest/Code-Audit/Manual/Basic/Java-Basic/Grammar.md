# Data
## Data Types
### Primitive
A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods, including number, boolean,character.
- byte - 1 byte, numbers from -128 to 127
- short - 2 bytes, whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
- int - 4 bytes, integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- long - 8 bytes
- float - floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- double - 8 bytes
- char - 2 bytes, single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
```
char charValue1 = 'B';
char charValue2 = 65;

special characters: 
backslash escape : \'  \" \\
escape sequences ï¼š \n -- New Line  \r -- Return \t -- Tab  \b -- Backspace

```
- boolean - values with two states: true or false

### Non-Primitive
 Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
- String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
  - stringName.length()
  - stringName.toUpperCase()
  - stringName.toLowerCase()
  - stringName.indexof("keyword")
  - stringName.concat(string2)
- Array - stores multiple values in a single variable, declare an array with a square brackets.Access or change the value by referring to the index number.
  - arrayName.length
  - Multidimensional Arrays
```java
type[] variableName;
type[] variableName = {value1, value2, value3};  //  type value1 = variableName[0];
type value2 = othervalue;

int[][] arrayName = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}};
arrayName[1][2];     // 1: the second array, 2: the third element
```
  
- Class

## Type Casting
Type casting is when you assign a value of one _primitive_ data type to another type.
- Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
- Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte


## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
```java
//declare veriables
type variableName = value;

// use final keyword to void others overwrite
final int name = 15;

// assign the same value to multiple variables
int x,y,z;
x = y = z

```
## Data Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values, including: 
Addition : +
Subtraction : -
Multiplication : * 
Division : / 
Modulus : %
Increment : ++
Decrement : --


# Handler
## IF...ELSE
```java
if (condition){
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
  }
  else{
   if the same condition is false
  }
```
### condition
-  usual logical conditions from mathematics: < > = >= == !=

### Short Hand
ternary operator consisting of three operands
```java
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
```
## Switch Statements
 The switch expression is evaluated once, the result of condition is compared with the value of each case, if there is a match, the corresponding block will be executed.Then when java reaches a break keyword, it break of the switch block and ignore the rest of cases.
```java
switch(condition){
case x:
  // code block1
  break;
case y:
  // code block2
  break;
  default:
  // code block3
}
```

##  Loop
### While
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
```java
while (condition){
 // code block to be executed
}
```
### For
#### Normal
When you know exactly how many times you loop:
```java
for (statement1; statement2; statement3){
  // code block
}
```

- statement1: execute before the execution of block
- statement2: define the judgement condition 
- statement3: execute after the execution of block

#### Nested Loop
Place a loop inside another loop, the inner loop will be executed for each iteration of outer loop.


#### For-Each
Exclusively used to loop through elements in and array:
```
for (type variableName : arrayName){
  // code block to variableName
}
```

#### Break/Continue
The break statement can be used to break out of a loop, the continue break this iteration and contunue the next iteration.
```java
for (statement1; statement2; statement3){
  if (condition1){
   // code2 block not code1, continue to loop
   continue;
  }
  if (conition2){
   // code2 block, finish the loop
   break;
   }
  // code1 block
}
```

# Method
- A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass parameters into a method, then using it to perform certain actions.
- Why use method? Define the code once, reuse many times.
- create: A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method and the parentheses()
```java
scope type methodName(parameters){...}
public static void main(String[] args){...}   //static: the method belongs to the class and not an object
```
- call: information can be passed to method as a parameter, which act as variable inside the method.
```
  System.out.printIn("Hello");
```
## Parameter
Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.
 
## Return
The void keyword indicates that the method should not return a value. Otherwise, you need to use a data type instead.

## Overloading
Multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters.

## Scope
In java, variables are only accessible inside the region they are created. 
- Method Scope: variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method
- Block Scope: Variables declared inside blocks of code are only accessible by the code between the curly braces

## Recursion
 Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

## OOP
 OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
 
## Class and object 
 Overall, a class is a template or "blueprint" for objects, and an object is an instance of a class. Everything in Java is associated with class and object, along with attributes and methods.
 
- Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.  A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
```java
public class ClassName{}
```
- An object is created from a class. You need to specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new.
```
ClassName objectName = new ClassName();

```


# Comment
Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable.
```java
