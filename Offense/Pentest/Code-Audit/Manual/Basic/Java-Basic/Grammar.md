## Data Types

### Primitive
A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.
#### 
- byte - numbers from -128 to 127
- short - 2 bytes, whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
- int - 4 bytes, integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- long - 8 bytes

- float - floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- double - 8 bytes


- char - 2 bytes, single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes

- boolean - values with two states: true or false

### Non-Primitive
- String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- Array
- Class

## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
```java
//declare veriables
type variableName = value;

// use final keyword to void others overwrite
final int name = 15;

// assign the same value to multiple variables
int x,y,z;
x = y = z

```




# Interface


# Class
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.  A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
```java
public class Main{}
```

# Object

# Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  System.out.printIn("Hello");}

```
## Comment
Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable.
```java
// on-line
```
