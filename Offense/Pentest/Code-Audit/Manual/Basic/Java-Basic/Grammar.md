## Data Types
### Primitive
A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods, including number, boolean,character.
- byte - 1 byte, numbers from -128 to 127
- short - 2 bytes, whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
- int - 4 bytes, integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- long - 8 bytes
- float - floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- double - 8 bytes
- char - 2 bytes, single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
```
char charValue1 = 'B';
char charValue2 = 65;

special characters: 
backslash escape : \'  \" \\
escape sequences ï¼š \n -- New Line  \r -- Return \t -- Tab  \b -- Backspace

```
- boolean - values with two states: true or false

### Non-Primitive
 Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
- String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
  - string.length()
  - string.toUpperCase()
  - string.toLowerCase()
  - string.indexof("keyword")
  - string.concat(string2)
- Array
- Class


## Type Casting
Type casting is when you assign a value of one _primitive_ data type to another type.
- Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
- Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte


## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.
```java
//declare veriables
type variableName = value;

// use final keyword to void others overwrite
final int name = 15;

// assign the same value to multiple variables
int x,y,z;
x = y = z

```
## Java Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values, including: 
Addition : +
Subtraction : -
Multiplication : * 
Division : / 
Modulus : %
Increment : ++
Decrement : --



# Interface


# Class
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.  A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
```java
public class Main{}
```

# Object

# Method

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
  System.out.printIn("Hello");}

```
## Comment
Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable.
```java
// on-line
```
