# What can python do?
- Web Application Server
- software development
- System scriping: read and modify files,
- Data handling, mathematics, connecting to database
- Automation workflows

# Advantages
- simple syntax similar to English
- fewer lines
- interpreter, no need compile
- new line to complete a command: using indentation to indicate a block of code

# Variables
 A variable is created once you first assign a value. It cannot start with a number, contains - or space. 
 ```python
 myVariableName = "Jayway"
 my_variable_name = "Jayway"
 ```
 
 - Type Conversion 
 ```python
 x = str(3)
 y = int(3)
 ```
 
 - Type
 ```python
 type(x)  # Class int
 
 ```
 - String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes
 ```python
 x = 'Jayway'
 x = "Jayway"  # same
 ```
 
 - Case-Sensitive
 ```python
 a = 1
 A = "Jayway"   # overwrite
 ``` 
 
 - Assign  multiple Variables
 ```python
 x, y, z = "a", "b", "c"
 x = y = z = "Jayway"
 ```
 - Print 
 ```python
 x = "Jayway"
 y = 5 
 print(x)
 print(x, y)  # Jayway 5
 
 ```
 - Global Variables
 Create a variable outside a function, use it inside the function. Use the global keyword, then the variable belongs to the global scope

# Data Types
Variables can store data of different types, to do diffrent things. Built-in Data types are as follow:
- Text Type:	str
- Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
  - complex : x = 1j
- Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
  - list(mutable) : x = ["a", "b", "c"]
  - tuple(immutable) : ("a", "b", "c")
- Mapping Type:	dict
  - dict : x = {"name" : "Jayway", "age" : 6}
- Set Types:	set, frozenset
  - set : x = {"a", "b", "c"}
- Boolean Type:	bool
- Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
  - bytes: x = b'Hello'
  - bytearray : x = bytearray(5)
- None Type:	NoneType
  - NoneType: x = None

## Specific Data Type
- x = str("Jayway")

# String
## Multiline : Using three single or double quotes
```python
a = '''line one
line two
line three'''
```
## String is a Array, can loop a String character 
```python
x = "Jayway"
print(x[0])  # first char
```
## Slicing 
```python
x = "Jayway"
print(x[2:5], x[:5], x[2:], x[-5:-2])  # third to fifth, begin to fifth, third to end, reverse fifth to third
```
## Modify
- upper() # upper case
- lower() # lower case
- strip()  # remove whitesoace from the beginning and end
- replace("before","after")
- split(",") # splits the string into substring arrays if find separator

## Format
The format method takes the passed argument and formats them, place them in the string where the placeholders {} are:
```python
x = "Jayway"
y = 18
txt = "My nme is {}, my age is {}"
print(txt.format(x, y))
```

## Escape Character
A escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

## Methods
- count("value") : the number of times a specified value occurs in a string
- encode(encoding="ascii", errors="ignore") : encode version of a string
- find("value") : like index, find the first occurence of the specified value, returns -1 if not found

# Boolean
- bool() : function evaluate any value to True or False, any string except empty string, any number except 0 , any list except empty one is true
- False value : False, None, 0 , "" , (), [], {}

# Operator
## Arithmetic 
- + - * / %  ** //

## Assignment
= += -= *= /=

## Comparision
== != >  < >= <=

## Logic
and or not

## Membership
in, not in, is not

## Bitwise
Used to covert the number into binary, then compare each bit : & | ^ ~ << >>

## Operator Precedence
Parentheses has the highest precedence, Multiplication * has higher precedence than addition +

# List
List items are ordered, changable, allow duplicate values
- Access/Change : list[index]
- Add : 
  - append(number, "value")
  - extend(list)
-
