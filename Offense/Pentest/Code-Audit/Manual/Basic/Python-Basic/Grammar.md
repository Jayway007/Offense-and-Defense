# What can python do?
- Web Application Server
- software development
- System scriping: read and modify files,
- Data handling, mathematics, connecting to database
- Automation workflows

# Advantages
- simple syntax similar to English
- fewer lines
- interpreter, no need compile
- new line to complete a command: using indentation to indicate a block of code

# Variables
 A variable is created once you first assign a value. It cannot start with a number, contains - or space. 
 ```python
 myVariableName = "Jayway"
 my_variable_name = "Jayway"
 ```
 
 - Type Conversion 
 ```python
 x = str(3)
 y = int(3)
 ```
 
 - Type
 ```python
 type(x)  # Class int
 
 ```
 - String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes
 ```python
 x = 'Jayway'
 x = "Jayway"  # same
 ```
 
 - Case-Sensitive
 ```python
 a = 1
 A = "Jayway"   # overwrite
 ``` 
 
 - Assign  multiple Variables
 ```python
 x, y, z = "a", "b", "c"
 x = y = z = "Jayway"
 ```
 - Print 
 ```python
 x = "Jayway"
 y = 5 
 print(x)
 print(x, y)  # Jayway 5
 
 ```
 - Global Variables
 Create a variable outside a function, use it inside the function. Use the global keyword, then the variable belongs to the global scope

# Data Types
Variables can store data of different types, to do diffrent things. Built-in Data types are as follow:
- Text Type:	str
- Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
  - complex : x = 1j
- Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
  - list(mutable) : x = ["a", "b", "c"]
  - tuple(immutable) : ("a", "b", "c")
- Mapping Type:	dict
  - dict : x = {"name" : "Jayway", "age" : 6}
- Set Types:	set, frozenset
  - set : x = {"a", "b", "c"}
- Boolean Type:	bool
- Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
  - bytes: x = b'Hello'
  - bytearray : x = bytearray(5)
- None Type:	NoneType
  - NoneType: x = None

## Specific Data Type
- x = str("Jayway")
