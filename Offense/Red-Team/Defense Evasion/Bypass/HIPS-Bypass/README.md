## Overall
  To fight against HIDS monitoring generally starts from the following aspects:
  
- Bypass monitor technology:
  - Bypass the command monitoring method so that HIDS cannot collect the log of command execution
  - Process and parameters of command execution can be tampered with so that false logs can be collected
- Bypass Detection model/rule:
  - Guess the strategy of the command alarm and bypass it
